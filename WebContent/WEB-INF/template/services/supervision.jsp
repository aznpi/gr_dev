								<p>Your employees are in constant communication with colleagues, customers, partners, and counterparties. These communications distribute critical information and contain unique documentation of your daily operations. But with thousands, or even millions, of communications sent and received every day, it can be difficult to regulate and monitor what your employees, customers, and other external stakeholders are saying.</p>
								<p>Compliance Reviewer gives you the tools to efficiently supervise large volumes of email, IM, texting, social media, voice, and other communications. Our policy-based approach helps you ensure adherence to internal policies and regulatory requirements, reduce legal risks, and protect your corporate reputation.</p>

																		<p>Financial firms are required to supervise their communications under FINRA Rule 3110, SEC Rule 204-2, IIROC Rule 29.7, and other regulations. These regulations require you to implement a supervisory program that is appropriate for your business lines, size, and risk. With Compliance Reviewer, you can automatically detect violations of regulatory requirements such as:</p>
																      	<ul>
																      		<li>Providing advice or recommendations that do not meet suitability or fiduciary standards</li>
								                                            <li>Overstating the performance or minimizing the risk of a financial product</li>

Implementing a supervisory program can help you identify and manage legal exposure and other risks before they damage your corporate reputation and operations. Compliance Reviewer helps you automatically detect risks such as:</p>

																      		<li>Potential litigation or other legal action against your organization or specific employees</li>
								                                            <li>Improper gifts and entertainment expenses in excess of legal or corporate limits</li>

								  	<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="features">
								  		<h4>Features</h4>
								  		<div class="description">
								  			<p><span class="bold">Unified supervision.</span> Monitor and review more than <a href="${baseUrl}/services/archice#date-feeds">45 data types</a> in a single system and interface, with options to enforce policies across all communications or create data type-specific policies.</p>
								  			<p><span class="bold">Automatic, policy-based flagging.</span> Implement precise supervision policies to automatically flag communications based on any combination of:</p>
								  			<ul>
								  				<li><span class="bold">Lexicons:</span> Create lists of keywords and phrases tailored to each type of violation (e.g. front running or gifts and entertainment), with Boolean, proximity, exact phrase, and other advanced operators to increase precision. Lexicons matches are highlighted for quick review.
								  				<li><span class="bold">Metadata:</span> Target your policies on relevant communications by using metadata criteria such as sender, recipient, group (e.g. region or department), data type, and attachment type.
								  				<li><span class="bold">Random sampling:</span> Specify random sampling percentages to three decimal places.</li>
											</ul>
											<p><span class="bold">Pre-built policies.</span> Leverage our policy catalog to quickly implement policies such as Anti-Money Laundering, Front Running, Fair and Balanced Advice, Customer Complaints, and Offensive Language. We have built our policy catalog based on best practices and more than 15 years of experience.</p>
											<p><span class="bold">Custom policies.</span> Create and enforce custom policies to accommodate your organization’s specific business lines and risks.</p>
											<p><span class="bold">Policy exclusions.</span> Minimize false positives by excluding disclaimers, boilerplate, attorney-client privileged communications, and other low risk or restricted content from triggering a policy match. You can base exclusions on a variety of criteria, including lexicons, subject, sender, recipient, and attachment name.</p>
											<p><span class="bold">Intuitive policy management.</span> Provide your administrators and senior compliance staff with an intuitive online interface and tools to create, review, and manage supervisory policies – no IT assistance required.</p>
											<p><span class="bold">Multi-tier supervisory structure.</span> Enforce segregation of duties and expedite escalation of issues to senior staff with role-based access controls that can map to your organization’s existing roles and reporting lines. We can support everything from a small firm where the CCO conducts daily reviews to multinational organizations with a complex three lines of defense structure across multiple entities, regions, and countries.</p>
											<p><span class="bold">Granular access rights.</span> Route communications to appropriate reviewers based on user, group, case folder, or other criteria. To meet privacy and confidentiality requirements, reviewers cannot search or review communications outside of their defined access rights.</p>
											<p><span class="bold">Compliance dashboard.</span> Quickly filter review queues by policy type, status, date, and other criteria.</p>
											<p><span class="bold">One-click review.</span> Use pre-set tags to review and take action on communications with one click, with the option to add notes to justify decisions. After selecting a tag, reviewers are automatically advanced to the next communication in their queue.</p>
											<p><span class="bold">Wizard commands.</span> Create wizards to simplify workflows and perform multiple actions with one click (e.g. tag a message as Escalated, add it to a case folder, and send an alert email to a senior compliance officer).</p>
											<p><span class="bold">Ad hoc investigations.</span> Use advanced search controls to conduct further investigation on a flagged communication or a targeted investigation on a specific employee or issue.</p>
											<p><span class="bold">Audit trails.</span> Document the full lifecycle of every communication, from import into Global Relay Archive to any reviews and related actions taken.</p>
											<p><span class="bold">Detailed reporting.</span> Generate ad hoc and scheduled reports to provide proof of review, monitor the activities of compliance staff and other reviewers, and assess the effectiveness and efficiency of your supervisory policies.</p>
											<p><span class="bold">Professional services.</span> Leverage the experience and expertise of our <a href="${baseUrl}/services/professional-services#compliance">Training team</a> to design and implement a supervisory program based on industry best practices.</p>
