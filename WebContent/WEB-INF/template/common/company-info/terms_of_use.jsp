								  			<p><strong>5.3 Archive Data Capture.</strong> Global Relay Archive is engineered to capture and archive incoming, internal and outgoing electronic communications of Customer.

								  			<p><strong>5.4 Monitoring Message Flow.</strong> Customer is responsible to monitor its delivery of each message type to Global Relay Archive. Global Relay will generate a daily email to Customer that reports statistics on Global Relay’s receipt and processing of each message type from Customer, and on each User of Customer. It is the responsibility of Customer to review and reconcile these reports, and Customer will notify Global Relay of any mail flow issues, anomalies or delivery failures. Customer shall also notify Global Relay of any upgrades, patches, or maintenance to Customer’s servers or message feeds which will result in an outage, disablement of journaling or other disruption of message flow by Customer, and Customer shall ensure that no messages are transmitted through its email/IM server(s) or otherwise until Customer’s upgrade, patch, or maintenance is complete, and that journaling or message flow is enabled again by Customer or Customer’s third party vendors.</p>
								  			<h4>6. Instant Messaging, Social Networks and Email Services</h4>

Accordingly, Global Relay and its Partners expressly disclaim any and all liability relating to, connected with, or arising from Third Party Networks including any outages, schema changes, version changes, delivery delays, failures, corruptions, discontinued services or termination of service. Additionally, Customer is responsible to ensure its end Users only use versions of the applicable Third Party Network clients that are expressly supported by Global Relay Archive. Customer may contact Global Relay Support to confirm an updated list of supported Third Party Networks. To assist with the administration and maintenance of accurate data flow and user statistics, where an end User of a particular Third Party Network or an Email Service has not accessed that particular Third Party Network or Email Service for more than 90 consecutive days, the User’s license related to such Third Party Network or Email Service will be deemed abandoned.

								  			<p><strong>7.2 Security Breaches.</strong> Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, Global Relay reserves the right, in the event of a reasonable detection or perceived detection of suspicious activity or other security issues whatsoever, including a disaster that impacts internet security infrastructure or transmissions in a manner which may cause undue risk to Global Relay, Customer, or Archived Data, to temporarily suspend Customer’s access to any of the Services as is necessary. During any such suspension, Global Relay will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve and mitigate the risk and resume Customer's use of the Services and access to the Archived Data as soon as possible, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the integrity of the Archived Data. Any such suspensions will only be in effect during and no longer than a period equal to the time necessary to eliminate risk to Global Relay Services and the Archived Data. </p>

In the event that a party is legally compelled under Legal Process, through whatever means, to provide access to the Archived Data or other Confidential Information, then the disclosing party undertakes, to the extent legally permissible, to provide the other party with notice of such an event as promptly as is reasonably practicable, so as to afford the other party the opportunity to limit, monitor, control or prevent the disclosure, unless the disclosing party is requested during an inspection, investigation or examination, or is otherwise prohibited by law, from providing notice to the other party. Customer is responsible for all costs associated with any legally compelled disclosure of its Archived Data. Nothing in this Agreement shall cause a party to fail to honor or comply with any Legal Process on a timely basis.</p>
								  			<p><strong>8.3 Privacy of Information.</strong> For information on how User information is collected, used and disclosed by Global Relay, please refer to Global Relay's Privacy Policy. Notwithstanding this policy, by accepting the Services Terms &amp; Conditions, Customer is deemed to have consented to the use and disclosure of information of Customer by Global Relay for purposes relating to the Services, including marketing and promotion initiatives of Global Relay.</p>
								  			<p><strong>8.4 Marketing.</strong> Global Relay has the right to refer to Customer, directly and indirectly, in marketing materials, case studies and on Global Relay's website to indicate that Customer uses the Services and for general information and marketing purposes regarding Global Relay's customer base. Global Relay shall not issue any press release announcing the engagement or use by Customer of the Services without the express prior written consent of Customer. Any press release or case study shall be subject to the review and prior written approval of both parties and this approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.</p>	<h4></h4>
								  			<h4>9. Fees and Payments</h4>
								  			<p><strong>9.1 Fee Agreement.</strong> Customer will execute a Fee Agreement which sets forth the specific Services subscribed for by Customer during the Contract Term, as well as the Fees, Prices, initial User count, payment method, Billing Cycle and Effective Date for the commencement of this Agreement. Customer agrees to pay all Fees due under this Agreement. In the event Customer continues to use the Services beyond the expiry of any Trial Period, the Contract Term or after a termination date (as applicable), then, without Notice to the contrary, the terms of the most recent Fee Agreement together with any subsequent Change Orders will be deemed to have been accepted or continued (as applicable). </p>
								  			<p><strong>9.2 Change Orders.</strong> Where Customer makes adjustments to its Services after the Effective Date, including (as applicable) reported or actual changes to the number of Users or Accounts, adding or deleting Services, adding or deleting archived message types, exceeding storage usage allotments, customization of support packages, the import and export of Legacy Data or Archived Data, or other demands of Customer that alter the numbers or the Services set forth in the Fee Agreement, corresponding adjustments will be made to Customer’s Fees (each a <strong>"Change Order"</strong>). Any Change Order will be based on the standard Global Relay Prices unless as otherwise set forth in the Fee Agreement, and be reflected in the invoice for a subsequent Billing Cycle or billed at the time of order (as applicable). During the Contract Term, Customer will maintain a minimum of 75% of the initial User count stated in Customer’s Fee Agreement, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties in writing. Accordingly, for any Change Order for a decrease in Fees due to a drop in User count below this minimum, the minimum will apply.

								  			</p>
								  			<p><strong>9.3 Dispute, Discrepancy and Refund.</strong> The Fees billed on any invoice will be deemed to be correct if not disputed by Notice within 30 days of the invoice date. Any Notice by Customer must provide Global Relay with sufficient detail of the Fee discrepancy, in addition to other information that Global Relay may reasonably request, in order to review and resolve the dispute. The parties will work together in good faith to promptly and efficiently resolve the discrepancy to the satisfaction of both parties. During any resolution period, Customer will continue to pay all undisputed amounts to Global Relay. Where a discrepancy is determined, refunds will apply as follows: (i) if Customer has paid the invoice in full, a credit note for the discrepancy will be applied against future Fees; or (ii) if Customer has not paid the discrepancy, a credit note will be applied to the unpaid portion of Customer’s invoice. Alternatively, if the discrepancy is greater than $200.00, Customer may request a refund.</p>
								  			<p><strong>9.4 Payment.</strong> Unless alternative payment terms have been specified in the Fee Agreement or are otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties in writing, Customer will pay all undisputed Fees (i) on the invoice due date, (ii) in advance, based on a monthly Billing Cycle, and (iii) by pre-authorized credit card. Customer, if paying by credit card, hereby gives its authorization for all payments required to keep its accounts current, such payments to normally be debited in the amount of the Fees established in the Fee Agreement or as is calculated after any subsequent Change Order. All credit card payments will normally be processed on the invoice due date. </p>
								  			<p><strong>9.5 Non-Payment.</strong> Any undisputed Fees due and owing by Customer (or disputed in bad faith) under this Agreement that are not received by Global Relay within 30 days of receipt of the invoice may be subject to a service charge of one and one half percent per month, or the maximum charge permitted by law, whichever is less, as calculated from the invoice due date until the date payment is received by Global Relay. Such non-payment is also deemed to be a material default by Customer, and Global Relay may suspend Customer's Services pursuant to the notice requirements and procedures of Section 14.2. Where Customer has been suspended for non-payment, the Services will not be reactivated until Global Relay receives payment in full of the outstanding balance, in addition to a $200.00 reactivation fee. Global Relay has no obligation to return Archived Data to Customer until Global Relay receives payment in full of the outstanding balance and any payment disputes are resolved. Customer shall not be entitled by reason of set-off, counterclaim, abatement or other similar deduction to withhold any amount due to Global Relay.</p>
								  			<p><strong>9.6 Taxes of Customer.</strong> Global Relay is not responsible for any additional fees, charges, or taxes imposed by Customer's local authorities, State or Province, other than any applicable GST/HST in Canada, in which case Global Relay, or a Partner, will bill to and collect from Customer and remit to the government authorities. Any other taxes or fees which may be due must be paid to the proper authorities directly by Customer.</p>

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY GLOBAL RELAY, AND ACCEPTED BY CUSTOMER, ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY CUSTOMER FROM GLOBAL RELAY OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
								  			<h4>11. Release</h4>
								  			<p>Customer releases Global Relay from and agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Global Relay, its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents and Partners from and against any claims, actions, suits, demands, proceedings (collectively <strong>"Claims"</strong>) and damages, liabilities, obligations, costs or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable legal fees (collectively <strong>"Damages"</strong>), in any way directly or indirectly connected with, arising out of or resulting from Customer's: (a) negligent or wrongful use of the Services, (b) breach of this Agreement, or (c) combination of the Services with other products, processes, or material not provided or approved in writing by Global Relay, whether or not due to any act, error, omission or negligence by Global Relay or any of its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or others whom it is in law responsible.</p>
								  			<h4>12. Limitation of Liability</h4>
								  			<p><strong>12.1 No Liability for Loss.</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, or any other related agreements, in no event shall either party be liable to the other party, its clients, or any other party (any of which, a <strong>"Person"</strong>) under or in relation to this Agreement for any Claims or Damages for any special, direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages (including loss of use, loss of production, loss of profits or revenues, loss of markets, economic loss, loss of good will, exemplary loss, anticipated or otherwise), that may be suffered or incurred by any Person, resulting from any matter under or relating to this Agreement or the use of, inability to use or access, or performance of any of the Services, and notwithstanding that such party may have been advised of the possibility of any such Claims or Damages and regardless of whether any of the foregoing is determined to constitute a fundamental breach or failure of essential purpose.</p>
								  			<p><strong>12.2 Limit.</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the total monetary liability of each party to the other in respect of all Claims and Damages for any matter relating to the Services or this Agreement, whether in contract or tort or under any other theory of liability, including without limitation for any breach of or default under this Agreement or any misrepresentation or negligence, in the aggregate, shall not exceed the amount of Fees Customer has paid to Global Relay under this Agreement in the three months preceding the Claim. This limit is cumulative and the existence of more than one Claim will not enlarge the limit. The parties acknowledge that these limitations of liability and the allocation of risk, including waiver of consequential damages, are an essential element of the bargain between the parties and part of the consideration for the agreed upon Prices and Fees, and in their absence the Prices and Fees and this Agreement would be substantially different.</p>
								  			<h4>13. Amendments</h4>
								  			<p><strong>13.1 Agreement.</strong> The Fee Agreement will only be modified upon prior written agreement of both parties.  Global Relay reserves the right to amend any provision of these Services Terms &amp; Conditions from time to time, so long as amendments are posted at http://www.globalrelay.com/policies/terms-and-conditions. </p>
								  			<p><strong>13.2 Fee Changes.</strong> Prices for the Services will not increase during the Initial Term. After the Initial Term, on an annual basis, Global Relay may increase the Fees by amounts equal to or less than the percent increases in the CPI-U, using the percent change in the level of the CPI-U between the month prior to the Effective Date and that same prior month in each subsequent year. In addition, Prices are subject to change and any price changes will take effect on renewal of the Contract Term set out in the Fee Agreement, upon written Notice to Customer of any changes in Prices and resulting Fees by the end of the Contract Term. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, continued use of the Services by Customer for 15 days past the end of the Contract Term constitutes acceptance by Customer of any modified Prices for the Services for the next Contract Term.</p>
								  			<p><strong>13.3 Service Changes.</strong> Customer acknowledges that Global Relay may provide automatic Releases to the Services from time to time, provided that any such Releases do not materially adversely detract from the performance levels of the Services. To the extent possible, Releases will be provided upon reasonable Notice by Global Relay. Global Relay also reserves the right to discontinue any Service, temporarily or permanently, upon Notice of at least 30 days. Customer agrees that Global Relay shall not be liable to Customer or any third party for any modification or discontinuance of any of the Services; provided however, that in the event Global Relay discontinues any Services, Global Relay will endeavor to provide Customer as much notice as is reasonably practicable.</p>
								  			<h4>14. Term, Suspension and Termination</h4>
								  			<p><strong>14.1 Term.</strong> This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date. This Agreement will continue in effect, together with any subsequent renewals, revisions, or Change Orders until terminated pursuant to this Section 14, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. The Fee Agreement sets out the initial Contract Term (the <strong>"Initial Term"</strong>). At the expiry of the Initial Term, the Fee Agreement (including any applicable Change Orders) shall, subject to Section 13.2, be automatically renewed annually for additional one year terms (each a <strong>"Renewal Term"</strong>), unless terminated by written Notice by either party at least 60 days prior to the expiry of the Initial Term or Renewal Term (as the case may be), or the parties otherwise negotiate terms of a new Fee Agreement.</p>
								  			<p><strong>14.2 Suspension.</strong> Without limiting other remedies, Global Relay reserves the right to suspend any and all of Customer’s Services if Customer is in material breach or default in performance of its obligations under this Agreement or has otherwise violated this Agreement, if the reason for that breach, default or violation is not remedied to Global Relay’s reasonable satisfaction within 30 days following Customer's receipt of written Notice of (i) the breach, default or violation, or (ii) non-payment pursuant to Section 9.5. The onus is on Customer to resolve or cure the specific concerns to Global Relay's (and to Partner's, if applicable) reasonable satisfaction prior to the Services being reinstated. Global Relay will not be liable to Customer for any suspension in accordance with this Section 14.2.  Fees will continue to apply and accrue during any suspension of the Services by Global Relay.</p>
								  			<p><strong>14.3 Termination.</strong> Subject to the provisions of this Section 14 and proper Notice pursuant to Section 15.4 to Global Relay Legal or Customer's Contact, as applicable, upon termination of the Services by either party, all rights under this Agreement and the provision of Services will terminate in accordance with this Agreement. If Customer is using Global Relay Archive Services, this includes termination of all access to Global Relay Archive. Continued use by Customer of the Services beyond the date of termination will result in a continuation of Fees in accordance with this Agreement. Neither party will be liable to the other for any termination of the Services in accordance with this Agreement and the following terms:</p>
								  			<p class="indent-para"><strong>14.3.1 Termination by Customer.</strong> Customer may terminate this Agreement (i) at the expiration of the Contract Term or current Renewal Term (as the case may be) stated in the Fee Agreement; or (ii) upon Global Relay's material breach or default in performing its material obligations under this Agreement, if the reason for that breach or default is not remedied within 60 days following Global Relay's receipt of written Notice of such breach or default. In the case where there is not a Fee Agreement with a defined Contract Term, Customer may terminate this Agreement upon 120 days’ Notice. For termination under subsection 14.3.1(ii), Customer will not be charged for any and all Fees owed by Customer for the remainder of the Contract Term (or remainder of the Billing Cycle if the Contract Term is not defined) and a refund will be given for any Fees prepaid by Customer. In no event shall any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any Fees payable to Global Relay for the period prior to the effective date of termination.</p>
								  			<p class="indent-para"><strong>14.3.2 Termination by Global Relay.</strong> Global Relay may terminate this Agreement (i) at the expiration of the Contract Term or current Renewal Term (as the case may be) stated in the Fee Agreement; or (ii) where Customer has been suspended pursuant to Section 14.2, or upon Customer’s material breach or default in performing its material obligations under this Agreement, if the reason for that suspension, breach or default is not remedied within 60 days following such suspension or Customer's receipt of written Notice of such breach or default (as applicable). For termination under subsection 14.3.2(ii), Customer will be charged for any and all Fees owed by Customer for the remainder of the Contract Term (or remainder of the Billing Cycle if the Contract Term is not defined) and no refund will be given for any Fees prepaid by Customer. </p>
								  			<p class="indent-para"><strong>14.3.3 Termination on Bankruptcy.</strong> This Agreement shall terminate upon Notice with proof of the dissolution or bankruptcy of either party where (a) a party is declared insolvent or adjudged bankrupt by a court of competent jurisdiction or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (b) if a petition in bankruptcy or reorganization or an arrangement with creditors is filed by or against that party and is not dismissed within 60 days. Upon such termination, Customer will be charged for any and all Fees owed by Customer up to the date of termination, provided that, if Customer directs Global Relay to continue to preserve its Archived Data, the Fees for Services set forth in the Fee Agreement will continue to apply.</p>
								  			<p><strong>14.4 Return or Deletion of Archived Data.</strong> At any time, including up to 120 days following the effective termination of Global Relay Archive Services, Customer may request by written direction the return of a copy of its Archived Data stored by Customer in Global Relay Archive for a fee as set forth in the Fee Agreement, or otherwise at Global Relay’s standard rates, based on the digital media and format requested and amount of Archived Data to be returned. Alternatively, Customer may engage Global Relay to preserve a Static Archive of existing Archived Data with online access for Administrator(s), or may instruct Global Relay to delete the Archived Data upon written Direction to Global Relay. Upon request by Customer, Global Relay will provide written confirmation that the Archived Data has been properly disposed of. In the event that Global Relay does not receive written direction from Customer requesting the return of a copy of its Archived Data prior to the expiry of the 120 days following the effective termination (the “Abandonment Date”), then Customer is hereby put on notice that Global Relay may, without liability to Customer, delete all Customer's Archived Data after the Abandonment Date. Global Relay will provide at least 45 days’ Notice before any such deletion. Notwithstanding any of the above, Global Relay will not be liable to Customer with respect to Customer's Archived Data that remains in Global Relay Archive after the Abandonment Date.</p>
								  			<p><strong>14.5 Survival.</strong> Sections 5.1 ("Ownership and Control of Archived Data"), 8 ("Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure"), 10 ("Limited Warranty"), 11 ("Release"), 12 ("Limitation of Liability"), this Section 14 (“Term, Suspension and Termination”), and any other provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
								  			<h4>15. Miscellaneous</h4>
								  			<p><strong>15.1 Relationship of the Parties.</strong> Customer acknowledges that Global Relay, as a service provider, is an independent contractor, and the parties agree that no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.
