He also holds a patent for full resolution stereoscopic display, which arose out of his investigation of the feasibility of digital photogrammetric workstations. For Mercury Scheduling, Peter developed Magellan — a real-time airline crew scheduling product to which many worldwide airlines entrusted their entire business. At Realm Dynamics, Peter’s team developed a multi-tenanted cloud-computing platform for J2EE Enterprise Applications in the SMB market.</p>
