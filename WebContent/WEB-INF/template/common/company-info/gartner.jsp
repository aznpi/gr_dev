							<h4>Global Relay Named a "Leader" in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Information Archiving for Second Straight Year</h4>
							<div class="description">
								<p>Global Relay has been named a "Leader" in Gartner Inc.’s Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Information Archiving for the second consecutive year. The report evaluated 20 user content archiving vendors based on Completeness of Vision" and "Ability to Execute."</p>
								<p>Global Relay is the leading provider of cloud-based electronic message archiving, compliance and supervision solutions for the global financial sector and other highly regulated industries. In 1999, Global Relay was one of the first to recognize the valuable business information and intellectual capital contained in new forms of unstructured user content such as email. For the past fifteen years, the company has designed and developed innovative cloud solutions that allow organizations to not just preserve, but also efficiently access, search, and analyze user content such as email, IM, social media, and mobile messaging. Today, Global Relay aims to redefine archiving by providing all of an organization’s employees with flexible and intuitive workspaces tailored to their roles – from in-house counsel conducting eDiscovery to compliance officers supervising employee communications.</p>
								<p>"We are very pleased to once again be recognized as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant", said Global Relay CEO Warren Roy. "We have established ourselves at the forefront of the industry as it shifts to the cloud by focusing our efforts on developing intuitive, secure, and compliant SaaS archiving solutions that can scale to meet the needs of any organization. We believe our continuing growth is a testament to all we have built through early adoption of the cloud and a commitment to being a long-term, independent technology player."</p>
								<p>In its report, Gartner also highlighted the significance of regulatory compliance as an element of archiving, recommending that regulated organizations look for vendors with "vendor certifications and relationships with auditors and regulatory bodies"1 and noting that, "Some vendors are specifically certified to help financial services firms maintain compliance and, as a part of that certification, have close ties with regulatory bodies such as FINRA."</p>
								<p>Global Relay is a subject matter expert in regulatory compliance and provides all customers with access to 24x7 audit and eDiscovery support. The company provides services to almost 50% of FINRA-regulated broker-dealers, as well as 22 of the top 25 global banks.</p>
